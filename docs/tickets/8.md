# Phase 4c — Notification Tuning

**Scope:** Client UI + backend endpoint

## Notification Tuning

Granular per-event-type controls:

- Direct responses: always (non-configurable baseline).
- Heartbeat results: only when action was taken (not `HEARTBEAT_OK`).
- Sub-agent completions: optional.
- Cron job failures: optional (successes silent by default).
