# Phase 4d — Voice Messages

**Scope:** Client UI + on-device transcription

## Voice Messages

Send voice notes that are transcribed client-side before sending as text.

- **Apple:** Use the Speech framework for on-device transcription.
- **Before building:** Check upstream nanobot development for multimodal/voice support that could be merged in to reduce effort.
- Bot responds with text (no voice synthesis in scope for now).
