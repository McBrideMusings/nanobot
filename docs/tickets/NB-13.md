# File Links & @References in Chat

**Scope:** Cross-referencing features between chat and workspace

## Bot Message Links

- `[[file:AGENTS.md]]` renders as a clickable green-tinted pill button → navigates to Files tab and opens the file
- `[[canvas]]` renders as a clickable blue-tinted pill button → navigates to Canvas tab
- Navigation handler: sets `pendingFile` state + switches active tab

## User @Mentions

- Typing `@` in the input field triggers an autocomplete dropdown
- Dropdown lists workspace file paths, max 8 results
- Tab/Enter selects the highlighted item
- Escape dismisses the dropdown
- `@SOUL.md` in sent messages renders as a clickable green pill (same as file links)

## Dependencies

- NB-18 (Navigation Overhaul) — tab switching
- NB-21 (Enhanced Files Tab) — file deep linking

## Reference

Prototype lines 104–131, 424–485
