# Phase 4b — Bot Profile View

> **Superseded by NB-26** — Enhanced Bot Profile covers all original scope plus dynamic bot-updatable status fields, 3D avatar integration, and bottom sheet presentation.

**Scope:** New view + backend endpoint

## Bot Profile View

A dedicated view for the bot's identity, accessible by tapping the bot's avatar/name in the chat header.

- **Name and description** — pulled from `IDENTITY.md` or `SOUL.md` in the workspace.
- **Current status** — idle, working, sleeping (driven by agent state).
- **Uptime** — how long the agent has been running.
- **Stats** — messages exchanged, tasks completed, heartbeats run.
