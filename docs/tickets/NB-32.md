# Phase 3b — Inline Media

**Scope:** Client UI

## Receiving Media Inline

Render images and video inline in chat when the bot includes media URLs. The `OutboundMessage.media` field already exists but is unused.

- Images: thumbnail in the bubble, tap to view full-size.
- Video: inline player with playback controls.
- No upload pipeline needed — this is display-only for bot-provided URLs.
