# Phase 4a — Workspace Inspector & Markdown Editor

**Scope:** New views + backend endpoints

## Workspace Inspector

Browse the bot's workspace files (markdown files, memory, daily notes, HEARTBEAT.md, etc.).

- File browser view showing workspace structure.
- Tap a file to view with rendered markdown.
- Edit button switches to a built-in markdown editor.
- Save writes changes back to the workspace.
- Shares the markdown rendering component from Phase 2.

## Built-in Markdown Editor

A reusable editing component for markdown files. Used by the workspace inspector and potentially other views. Supports:

- Syntax-aware text editing.
- Preview toggle (edit / rendered view).
- Save/cancel actions.
